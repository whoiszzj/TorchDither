## Introduction
This is an unofficial implementation of the paper "Stochastic Floyd-Steinberg dithering on GPU:  image quality and processing time improved".
Hope this implementation can help you to understand the paper better and use the algorithm in your project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- PyTorch 2.2.2 (not restricted to this version, but this is the version I used)
- CUDA 11.8 (not restricted to this version, but this is the version I used)

## Usage
```shell
git clone https://github.com/whoiszzj/TorchDither.git
cd TorchDither
pip install .
```
